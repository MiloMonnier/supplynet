\title{Latora and Marchiori efficiency}
\usage{
efficiencyLM(g)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{An igraph object.}
}
\value{
A numeric between 0 and 1.
}
\description{
Adapted
Based on characterisic Ã¢th length Intergates spatial distance.
Normalized by ideal efficiency, a situation in whihc all nodes are directly
connected
 Unlike average distance, this metric is correctly defined even if the graph
is not connected.
}
\details{
For aggregated graphs, road distance cannot be used. Thus, its uses
euclidian distance based on \code{x} and \code{y} vertices attributes.
}
\examples{
library(igraph)
set.seed(123)
## Generate 100 random spatial networks with increasing density
genGraph = function(p) {
  g = erdos.renyi.game(10, p)
  V(g)$x = runif(10)
  V(g)$y = runif(10)
  g
}
x = seq(0, 1, by=0.01)
lg = lapply(x, genGraph)
## Efficiency increases with density
y = sapply(lg, efficiencyLM)
plot(x, y)
## Local efficiency is average efficiency of local subgraphs
## dg = decompose.graph(g)
## mean(sapply(dg, efficiencyLM))
