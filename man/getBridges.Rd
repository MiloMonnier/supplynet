\title{Get bridges edges of a graph}
\usage{
getBridges(g)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{An igraph object}
}
\value{
an edge sequence of the graph defined as bridges.
}
\description{
An edge in an undirected connected graph is a bridge iff removing it disconnects
the graph. For a disconnected undirected graph, definition is similar, a bridge
is an edge removing which increases number of disconnected components.
Function is available in igraph C version, but not in R.
