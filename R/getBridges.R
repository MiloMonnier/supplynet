#' Get bridges edges of a graph
#'
#' An edge in an undirected connected graph is a bridge iff removing it disconnects
#' the graph. For a disconnected undirected graph, definition is similar, a bridge
#' is an edge removing which increases number of disconnected components.
#' Function is available in igraph C version, but not in R.

#' @param g An igraph object
